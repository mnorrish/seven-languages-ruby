### Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

# Ruby

Some play with the Ruby programming language while working through the book, [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X), by Bruce A. Tate. 

Unlike the book I've choosen to use Ruby version 2.5.
