### Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

# Ruby

Some play with the Ruby programming language while working through the book, [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X), by Bruce A. Tate.

The code in this repo is based on the self-study exercises from each of the three days covered in the book.
A few extra niceties have been added to each exercise to explore the language further.

_Ruby version 2.5 has been used whereas the book recommends 1.8._
